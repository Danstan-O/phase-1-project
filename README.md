# phase-1-project
I did a personal portfolio project for marketing purposes and to increase my client outreach in the near future.
In the project I used html and css mostly with a little javascript to aid in the button scrolling functionalities.
The HTML displays the home page which has a welcoming message, my hobbies and other information in the about me tab,
my education background in the education tab and my contact information in case someone wants to reach out to me.
In the contact information I also have a form list that someone can fill in.
In the project I mostly focused on css-styling to give the portfolio a good look.
I did a black portfolio background so that the blue, white and yellow colours can stand out and provide a great impression to a website visitor.
The blue photo margin was to compliment the photo background.
